# Artur Kulembetov - CV

## Overview

Full-Stack Product Engineer with expertise in building secure, scalable applications. At presentsimple.ai, I designed an OAuth authentication system with role-based access control and one-tap login using React, Tailwind CSS, NestJS, and NextAuth.js. I automated the delivery pipeline, scaling output from 4 templates per month to 10 per day (90%+ time reduction) and delivering over 300 layouts with consistent 30-minute turnaround.

Architected and deployed a Figma-to-Code microservice in Python (SQLAlchemy, Poetry), automating data extraction and SQL generation. Supported 1,000+ daily PostgreSQL operations and reduced query runtime from 30s to 1s via bulk inserts and query optimization. Introduced system-wide asynchronous processing with asyncio and aiohttp, enabling concurrent operations.

Led a cross-functional team of 6 (3 designers, 3 engineering interns) over a 3-month cycle. Established engineering quality standards with Pre-commit hooks and expanded pytest coverage to 80%, cutting production bugs by 40%. Improved scalability by replacing manual data entry with automated template infrastructure, achieving 3x higher reuse.
